// registry-backed display changes (CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY) hung VDD and froze the
// whole system in testing, so only the in-place mode switch below is used, and
// only before capture starts.
// Disabling/re-enabling the VDD device works, but capturing its monitor afterwards
// hung the graphics stack too, so when the tablet goes away its windows are moved
// back to the main screen instead.
